A (abitrarly themed) ncurses game heavily inspired by [A Dark Room](http://adarkroom.doublespeakgames.com/). Gameplay is pretty limited as this was just a fun project to learn some about C. I'm sure there are some questionable design decisions, but it was a good learning experience nonetheless. I've hopefully improved since.

The game is about surviving the (christmas) wasteland/wilderness. Movement costs food and water which can be replenished by scavenging. The idea was for it to be an unforgiving, instant restart and try again style.
